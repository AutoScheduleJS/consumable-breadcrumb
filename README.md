# Plot
DB of all grocery products associated with supermarket & price.
Could use products info from OpenFoodFacts. We want it to be focused on local options, taking into account small market, itinerant market, etc...

# SaaS Application
Game: race number of scanned missing articles in a store.
Easily scan articles in a store -> app know in which store you are, you just have to scan and type the price.

scan a receipt to enrich the DB.

Give a shopping list and a position, get a list of roadmap (like GMap results for route), with associated prices (and time needed)

# Architecture
DB with: stores with products availability, local store with products availability & prices, products.
MongoDB: stores with mean of its local stores about products info.
local store which overwrite its store info.
Neo4J: Products with category as node.
for discount code, maybe use a new field with { function: fnName, productId: }

OR:
Neo4J: Products with category and link to main stores. Pros: with product linked to store, we should filter products by selecting store first. MongoDB for local store. For all independant markets, regroup them (per region)

main workflow: user has a list of starred local stores + list of products (family/generic with quality or real product).
With Neo4J, we retrieve real product (behind generic one - resulting in potentially a lot of products)
We check store that have the products. If there is no information, we check the associated main store.

How to handle generic name ? "strawberry jam" = generic ; "jam" = category -> no distinction necessary between both. Manual organisation
packaging (freeze, can, fresh): product property -> from OFF DB: surgeles
chocolate: product property: % of cacao
alcool: product property: % of alcool
bio: array of labels
serving size
nutriments: nutriment per serving size
brand -> associate quality with brand. Brands are quite similar across country, no needs to differentiate them per country.
  how to handle multiple brands ? link a product to all brands. How to filter ?
  job to keep only relationship with most impact (discount/Premium Plus)
